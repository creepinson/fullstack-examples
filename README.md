# Instructions for Developers

Begin by replacing the logo.png file with your own logo, but make sure it is named logo.png and is in the assets folder.

Then create a .env file at the root of the project and enter the following, but with its values replaced by your own:

```env
stripeKey=PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
siteName=Example Site
```

Then, to run the project, simply type:

> npm run start

in your terminal and hit enter.
